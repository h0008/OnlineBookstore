# Responsive Design Checklist

## Test on these screen sizes:
- Mobile: 320px - 480px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1024px+

## Check these elements on each page:
- [ ] Navigation menu collapses/expands appropriately
- [ ] Book grids adjust column count based on screen width
- [ ] Images resize and maintain aspect ratio
- [ ] Text remains readable (not too small)
- [ ] Forms are usable (inputs large enough to tap on mobile)
- [ ] Adequate spacing between interactive elements on mobile
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on any screen size
